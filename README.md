### [Add Key-Value Pairs to JavaScript Objects](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-data-structures/add-key-value-pairs-to-javascript-objects)

## HINTS
- The foods object has already been declared.  All that is left to be done is to add three new `key-values`.
```js
OBJECT[{ KEY }] = { VALUE };
```
- The above code will create a new `key-value` within the object.
